# Socket.IO Godot Client

This is a [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/) and [Engine.IO](https://socket.io/docs/v4/engine-io-protocol/) Client addon for [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) written in [GDScript](https://gdscript.com/) that supports both polling and Websocket.

> This is still a work in progress and is not yet fully featured. Please make sure to check out the #todo section before using it. The current implementation is functional and works, but there are some known cases that have not been implemented or covered yet, not to mention unknown issues that may arise

## Compatibility

| Client version | Socket.IO server |
| -------------- | ---------------- |
| 0.x            | 4.x              |

> I havenâ€™t checked the current implementation with older versions of the Socket.IO server. I hereby ask you to do this and inform me if it works or not.

## Quickstart

Add the Socket.IO node to your tree and fill out the parameters in the Inspector, connect the signals via code or IDE, and use it.

```py
@onready var client: SocketIO = $SocketIO

func _ready() -> void:
    client.socket_connected.connect(_on_socket_connected)
    client.event_received.connect(_on_event_received)

func _on_connect_pressed() -> void:
    client.make_connection()

func func _on_socket_connected() -> void:
    client.emit("hello")
    client.emit("some_event", { "value": 10 })

func _on_event_received(event: String, data: Variant, ns: String) -> void:
    print("event %s with %s as data received" % [event, data])
```

## Todo:

#### Socket.IO

- emit with [acknowledgement](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/blob/main/docs/socket.io-protocol/v5-current.md#acknowledgement-1), [sample](https://socket.io/docs/v4/client-api/#socketemitwithackeventname-args)
- connect to Websocket only (disable polling)

#### Engine.IO

- auto-reconnect (in case of network glitch or server restart)
- timeouts ([if the client does not receive a ping packet within pingInterval + pingTimeout, then it SHOULD consider that the connection is closed](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/blob/main/docs/engine.io-protocol/v4-current.md#heartbeat))
- support binary ([headers](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/blob/main/docs/engine.io-protocol/v4-current.md#headers), [base64 encoded and `b` prefix](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/blob/main/docs/engine.io-protocol/v4-current.md#packet-encoding))
- noop packet
- packet queue/ordering for sending data in case of client disconnection for a while (?)
- error handling for `request.gd`
- WebTransport [requires: Add support for WebTransport in Godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/issues/3899)
